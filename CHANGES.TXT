== <xm2esf 1.00 RC3> ============== 10-02-2012

- Fixed an issue with the wrong or uninitialized note data as base on portamentos with note-on on the same row
- added license

! Compiler changed to FreeBASIC 0.24
! Linux version added for xm2esf, loadxm and esfopt

(xm2esfgui for linux coming soon)

== <xm2esf 1.00 RC2> ============== 09-28-2012

- Fixed Portamento up / down
- Fixed new notes not triggereing when effects 1xx and 2xx are on the same row 
- Fixed reset volume on note-on
- Fixed conditions for resetting volume on note-on
- Fixed current note value getting updated for 2xx but not 1xx
- Fixed terrible mistakes in portamento 3xx code..... 
  The checks weren't working, the conditions were wrong, 
  I'm surprised portamentos even worked in the first place
- Removed silly hacks 
- Fixed portamentos incorrectly carrying on from a non-slide effect (like arpeggio, vibrato, etc.), 
  taking previous, perhaps uninitialized data as base note

- Fixed volume slide effect value actually being ignored
- Fixed volume slide behavior
- Optimized Arpeggio code
- Optimized and fusioned portamento code
- New note code optimized a bit
- Remember & reload instruments when looping
- Fixed pitch related effects not carrying on after empty rows inbetween
- PSG frequencies get initialized by generating them on the fly, instead of loading from an external file
